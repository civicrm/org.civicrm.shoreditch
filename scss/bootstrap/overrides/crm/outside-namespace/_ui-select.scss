// This partial makes CRM modals appear on top of Bootstrap modals,
// this is needed when a CRM modal is opened from a Bootstrap modal.
// Bootstrap modals have z-indexes starting from 1040 and are incremented by 10 within each stacked modal.
// The fixed z-index works for stacking CRM modals since they are populated at the same DOM level.
// This partial assumes that the Bootstrap modal is very unlikely to be called from a CRM modal.
